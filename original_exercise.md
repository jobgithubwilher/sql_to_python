🧠 Original Problem Description

A large enterprise is currently running its analytics and data transformation workflows in a legacy environment — for example, using SAS, Alteryx, or purely SQL-based systems.

The company has decided to migrate all analytics workflows to Dataiku, a modern data science platform that uses Python, PySpark, and visual recipes.

However, the existing team of analysts are experts in SQL and their old tools, not in Python or Dataiku.
They’re worried that during the migration, they will:

lose productivity,

face a steep learning curve,

and spend a lot of time rewriting and validating existing queries or data flows manually.

🎯 Goal

Design a conversion tool (a “converter”) that helps analysts transition more easily from the old system to Dataiku.
The converter should be able to translate SQL logic into Python (pandas or PySpark) or into Dataiku-compatible recipes — so that analysts can start working productively right away without rewriting everything by hand.

💡 Deliverables

Solution Proposal

Define the exact problem your converter solves.

Describe how it works, who uses it, and why it’s the best approach.

Include a short roadmap for future improvements.

Proof of Concept (PoC)

A small working prototype showing that your idea is technically feasible.

This can be a script, notebook, or library that demonstrates the key functionality (for example, a SQL-to-Python converter).

🗓️ Outcome

You’ll present your converter to a panel of Dataiku Data Scientists in a short technical interview, explaining:

how it works,

why it helps,

and how it could evolve into a real solution for customers
